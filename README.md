# Hi 👋

I’m **Tushar**, an undergraduate at **NITK Surathkal** interested in **quantitative finance and market risk**.

I work with financial time-series data to understand **returns, volatility, drawdowns, and regime behavior**, focusing more on **risk dynamics** than return prediction.

---

## What I do
- Financial time-series analysis  
- Volatility & drawdown analysis  
- Rule-based strategy backtesting  
- Empirical experiments on market data  

---

## Tools
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Market data (NIFTY 50, crypto)

---

## Projects
- **NIFTY 50 Risk Analysis** – returns, volatility regimes, drawdowns  
- **Backtesting Engine** – strategy performance & failure analysis  

---

Learning by building and testing ideas on real market data.

I’m **Tushar**, an undergraduate at **NITK Surathkal** with a growing interest in **quantitative finance and market risk**. I enjoy working with market data to understand how uncertainty, volatility, and drawdowns shape real-world outcomes.

Currently, I’m working on empirical analysis of financial time-series, focusing on volatility regimes, risk behavior during stress periods, and simple rule-based trading strategies. My goal is not to predict prices, but to understand when and why models and strategies fail.

I mainly use **Python** for analysis, working with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, along with real market data such as the NIFTY 50 and crypto assets. I follow a simple workflow: clean data, ask clear questions, test ideas, and interpret results carefully.
